            <h3>Overview and Learning Objectives</h3>
                <p>For one day per week (Tuesdays), we will focus on visualization research. 
                We will read research papers on some topic/theme, students will make presentations about the papers, 
                and we will discuss. One goal is to try to develop ideas for new research projects. 
                On the other day per week (Thursdays), we will focus on visualization system/application development. 
                Students will learn how to develop interactive visualization tools using languages and libraries like 
                Vega-Lite, D3, and JavaScript.</p>
            <h3>Textbooks</h3>
                <p>There are no required textbook for this course. However, there are a collection of resources 
                that you should find helpful for assignments throughout the course. There are also readings 
                that we will cover throughout the course which are all available while on the GT VPN (or on 
                campus).</p>
            <h3>Course Format</h3>
                <p>The course will consist mainly of two parts: reading and discussing research papers about information 
                visualization, and learning how to program web-based visualizations (predominantly using d3.js). </p>
            <h3>Timelines</h3>
                <p>All assignments are due at 11:59pm on Friday. Late work will receive a 10% per day penalty. After 5 days, a 
                0% will be given and no submission will be accepted. Too much other work, gone for the weekend, ran out of 
                paper etc. are not emergencies. Advance notification to the instructor and TAs is expected in all but the most 
                severe emergency situations.</p>
                <p>However, it is understandable that life events and other reasons come up that may require you to miss a 
                deadline. As such, each student is given 2 “late days” that you can use throughout the semester. If you want 
                to use any of your late days, add a note (or comment) to the Canvas submission at the time you submit. 
                You cannot apply late days to assignments at the end of the semester or days after you submit your assignment. 
                These are intended to be used in a situation where life events happen, not to retroactively apply them at the 
                end of the semester. </p>
            <h3>Canvas</h3>
                <p>Canvas will be used for electronic submissions for most of the assignments, and for recording grades. 
                For contacting the instructor or the TAs, please use email or private Canvas messages.</p>
            <h3>Grading & Assignments</h3>
                <p>Final course grades may be curved (but not always). Grades of individual assignments will not be curved. If a curve is given, 
                it will only be curved up (not down). Any regrade requests should be emailed directly to the instructor and 
                need to describe the detailed concern for the regrade. Grading distributions for this course are:
                <ul>

        <h3>Reading Presentation</h3>
        <p>This is a group assignment where your group will present and lead discussion about the reading for a
           specific day. You will need to do one of these during the semester. Please use the link below to sign
            up for the reading for that day.</p>
        <p><b>Overall length:</b> Aim for roughly 20 minutes of total "content" (not counting discussion that will happen
           after). The discussion (including that coordinated by the Q&A coordinator) should be another 20-30 
           minute based on class engagement. Plan accordingly to make sure you have a good balance among the 4 
           roles/parts below.</p>
        <p><b>Roles:</b> Each group member will have specific roles to ensure that everyone contributes and participates. 
          These roles are to guide who presents what during the presentation, but all group members should read the 
          paper and contribute to the overall presentation for that day. All group members need to be present the 
          day they present.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Motivation Presenter: This person will present a brief overview of the paper.
            <ul>
              <li>Intro
                <ul>
                  <li>What is the motivation for the paper?</li>
                  <li>What is the problem it is trying to solve?</li>
                  <li>What is the goal?</li>
                  <li>What are the contributions?</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>What does the paper do?
                <ul>
                  <li>e.g., if it was a study, what did it study? If it is a visualization tool, what does it do?</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Example/Demo/Video/Result Presenter: This person presents an example or highlights the results of the paper
            <ul>
              <li>For a study, this could include a highlight of the results, example of findings, summaries of findings, etc.</li>
              <li>When videos are available, subsets of the videos can be used.</li>
              <li>When demos are available, showcasing the demo is good here.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Reflection/Future Work Presenter: This person presents an overview of the discussion/future work of the presented work (and potentially how it ties in to other readings this semester)
            <ul>
              <li>What does the paper say in terms of broader discussion or future work?</li>
              <li>Are there higher-level topics the paper reflects on?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Q&A Coordinator: This person will present a set of discussion questions for the class and generally lead discussion.
            <ul>
              <li>Questions could be about parts of the paper that seem "odd" or "limitations", potential applications to other areas/domains, impact, missing opportunities, etc.</li>
              <li>Try not to make these generic, like "what did you all think about the study?", but rather something more specific to the reading, such as "condition 2 had participants use only the second version of the visualization, do you all think that created a confound?</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>What to submit:</b> The 4 roles above should coordinate and create a single presentation slide deck of some sort. Feel free to use any online slide software (Google, PowerPoint, etc.) to make you slides. When you are done, download a .pptx of your presentation to this assignment. 
          Each team member must submit the file. </p>
        <h3>Reading Reflection</h3>
        <p>This individual assignment will have you think and reflect critically about one of the readings this semester and produce a reading reflection document.</p>

          and produce a reading reflection document.</p>
        <b>Reflection document requirements:</b>
          <ul>
          <li>2-3 pages. Single spaced, single column, reasonable font (~12pt)</li>
          <li>Don't just repeat the paper. Yes, most introduction sections of papers do a pretty good job giving a summary (or at least, they should!), but this assignment 
            should be more about a reflection on (and related to) the reading for that day. </li>
          <li>Consider the pattern of summary -> interpret -> reflect for the key points of the paper. That means that you should identify one or more key points made in the paper, 
            interpret what these mean, and then reflect more broadly on them. </li>
          <li>Useful to end your reflection document with open ended research questions, open discussion, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>What to submit:</b> Submit a pdf of your reflection document</p>
        <p><b>Due:</b> This assignment is due before the end of the semester, but you can select any reading throughout the semester and submit your reflection anytime before the end of the semester.</p>

        <h3>HW1 - Web Stack</h3>
        <p>For this assignment, you will practice using web stack basics and create a web page. For this, you have 2 
          options for what this page should be about: this course or a personal page for yourself. 
          You only have to pick and do one of these. Do not do both. The description for both is below.</p>
        <p><b>Option 1: Single web page for this course</b></p>
        <p>This course has a combination of material in multiple tabs on Canvas. Specifically, there is the 
          course syllabus (with course information), the schedule table, the readings, and the assignments. 
          Your task for this option is to create a single page, one-stop-shop for all this information.</p>
        <p>To accomplish this, you need to:</p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Create a single web page with navigation to the sections for each component: syllabus, 
            schedule table, readings, assignments (and description of the assignments)
            <ol type="1">
              <li>use HTML and CSS styles to change the fonts/look/feel of the site.</li>
              <li>Clicking on the the navigation link at the top of the page should scroll to the correct position on the page.</li>
              <li>(when descriptions of HW assignments are not yet available, just put "details TBD")</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Use Javascript to add elements dynamically based on data. Instead of repeating elements and content in static HTML pages, 
            use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM to add papers dynamically based on a data file.
            <ol>
              <li>Instead of creating a list for all the papers in static HTML, we have a data file for the paper information in a CSV. 
                Use this CSV and parse it using JavaScript to add the elements dynamically to the readings list as part of your webpage.</li>
              <li><a href="https://gatech.instructure.com/courses/368178/files/47478597?wrap=1">Reading List(CSV)</a></li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Use SVG to create some sort of visual element to show the grade distribution 
            (instead of the simple table/list on the site now)</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Option 2: Create a personal webpage for yourself</b></p>
        <p>For this option, your task is to create a webpage for yourself as a researcher. As I'm sure some of you have seen, 
          there are lots of those around used by our colleagues. Some of you may even already have one! More on that below.</p>
        <p>For this page, your goal is to create a single page that shares important information about yourself as a researcher. 
          If you select this option, the requirements for this page include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a single, scrollable web-page with categories about you as a researcher. At a minimum, these should be:
             About (with information about you), Publications (with a list of publications), Research Interests (with a 
             list of interests that you have regarding the research you work on)</li>
            <li>Use JavaScript to set up a way to populate your research papers from a data file. Similar to step 2 
              in Option 1 above, use JavaScript to dynamically add publications to your publication list based on a datafile. 
              The format of the file is up to you. </li>
            <li>Add some form of SVG to the webpage to show some aspect of your information in visual form 
              (or for design purposes)</li>
        </ol>
        <p><i>Note: If you already have a web page, you are welcome to use it. However, it must have the 
          components described above (at a minimum). Also, site that are created from other tools (e.g., Wordpress) 
          are not allowed for this assignment (and they likely will not fit the requirements).</i>
        </p>
        <p><b>What to submit:</b> You should put all the files for your webpage into a single folder, then create a .zip from the folder. Turn in this .zip. We will un-zip this, host the root folder, and test your submission. <i>Hint: be careful not to hard-code any paths relative to your machine. Use paths relative to the directory.</i></p>
        <h3>HW2</h3>
        <p><b>Details TBD</b></p>
        <h3>HW3</h3>
        <p><b>Details TBD</b></p>
        <h3>HW4</h3>
        <p><b>Details TBD</b></p>
        <h3>Research Proposal</h3>
        <p>This assignment will pull together content and skills you have developed over the course of the semester.
           This includes the topics and content of the reading and discussion during class, as well as the ability to
            articulate clear visualization research goals, questions, methods, etc. For this individual assignment, you 
            will write a proposal for a potential new research project in the area of information visualization regarding 
            one or more of the topics we covered this semester.</p>
        <p>A good place to start for this is to think about which "type" of research (and thus proposal) you want to focus on.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><i>New visualization tool:</i> Did one of the areas we cover reveal a gap for a new vis? New interaction 
            technique? Write up what this gap is and how your proposed work will cover this gap. Make sure you 
            discuss your design goals (and perhaps a few sketches of the visualization) to help describe what 
            you're proposing. </li>
          <li><i>New study:</i> Is there a gap in what we know about visualization in a specific area/topic? 
            Does it need a well-designed study to understand it better? Great! Write up what this gap is, 
            what the research questions are, and what you methodology is for answering it.</li>
          <li><i>Survey/Taxonomy:</i> Is there a topic we covered that is missing a survey or taxonomy of visualizations in that 
            area? This sometimes happens with really new topics. Ok, write up a proposal about how you are going to go about this. 
            What is your method for collecting the papers, how will you code/categorize them, etc? </li>
          <li>There are other "types", but these above should get your started</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since good research builds on prior work, it is recommended that you cite at least 5 references as part of your 
          proposal to situate your work (and likely define whatever gap/need you outlined). </p>
        <p>Ideally, the result of this is something that you could hand to a professor in a following semester to do 
          a independent study, or maybe even a PhD in vis</p>
        <p>In terms of evaluation, we will grade your proposal based on clarity, thoughtfulness, and how well it is 
          articulated. Does the proposal explain how the proposed work builds on existing work (and how)? Does the 
          methodology of what you propose match the need that you articulated? Is it scoped as something that would be
           accomplished in 1-2 semesters? We are looking for proposals that are not too simple, but also not way to 
           complex in scope.</p>
        <p><b>What to turn in: </b>2-4 page whitepaper proposing your research. Submit the pdf.</p>
